# Description
The primary objective of this project is to leverage data engineering techniques to enhance location-based services. By harnessing the Google Location API, we extract precise coordinates from address data. These coordinates are pivotal for powering our Streamlit application, enabling users to interact seamlessly with location-based data. The Docker containerization ensures easy deployment and scalability of our application, allowing for efficient management of resources. Through the application's frontend, users can input their address, triggering a request to the Google Location API. Subsequently, the application retrieves and displays nearby gas station locations on a map, providing users with valuable insights into gasoline prices in their vicinity.
